# Developer Portfolio

This is my first solo developer portfolio, built primarily with semantic HTML and a small amount of CSS for basic styling (tables, iframe, and layout).

## Pages

- `index.html` – Home / About Me / Featured projects
- `project.html` – Project overview table
- `blog.html` – Blog entries about my learning journey
- `resource.html` – Learning resources, definitions, and schedule
- `contact.html` – Contact / hire‑me form

## How to run

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.

## Live demo
